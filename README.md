# Simple Android Debloater

This software is in beta ðŸš§

Simple Android Debloater is a free and open source project to disable unwanted system apps that carriers / OEMs force install in our mobile phones.

This is an attempt like [Universal Android Debloater](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/) built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). 

Unlike UAD, this tool is aimed to be beginner friendly so as to not uninstall apps unexpectedly which can brick the device.

**Note**: *Disabling system apps can also soft brick the device*



## Features

### Standard features
- Disabling and Enabling a package
- Auto detect devices and heartbeats
- Customizable prompt settings
- Search and Filter Packages

### Features over UAD
- Labels and Discussions powered by Github Discussions
    - Can be crowdsourced and moderated
    - Refreshed automatically once a day and can be triggered manually
    - ![Discussion Screenshot](./static/screenshots/discussion.png)

    - ![Bulk Disable Screenshot](./static/screenshots/bulk_disable_packages.png)

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- In the phone
    - Make sure Usb Debugging is turned on
    - This requires one to enable developer options
- In the PC
    - Make sure to download [ADB Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools#downloads) for your PC.
    - ADB need not be in Path. Setting path is tedious in windows. 
    - Use settings -> custom_adb_path pointing to the downloaded folder
